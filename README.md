### Author: Alvaro Henriquez
## Introduction


## The Data
The dataset comes from Kermany et al. on [Mendeley](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/3). There is also a version on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) which is a subset of the Mendeley dataset. However, the code for downloading the dataset is included in the Jupyter Notebook titled `01-Project_setup.ipynb`.

## Requirements
This project was created using Google Colab. All of the required libraries are included in the Colab environment except for the `Baysian-Optimization`


```
## Example from the project
